## VS Build Tools ENV in PowerShell

There's a ready script to activate dev variables for currently installed VS Build Tools: `${workspace}\Enter-VSDev.ps1`. Just run it once in the new PowerShell session, if needed.


## Project Documentation

Document all important architectural decisions, design artifacts, and tasks in the `specs/architecture.md` and `specs/continuous_architecture_findings.md`.
This file should be updated as the project evolves.

Document there all important findings and changes to the architecture, tech stack, libraries, and project structure.

## Current Active Task important details

Keep all important information about current effort, assumptions, decisions and objectives in `/spec/plan.md`. Consult it often to stay on track. Mark clearly what's done and what remains. If something is not clear, update the plan.

Plan HAS to work in coordination with `/spec/architecture.md` and `/spec/continuous_architecture_findings.md`.
