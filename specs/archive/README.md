## Consolidated Into

All information from these documents has been consolidated into:

- **`specs/diarization.md`** - Complete diarization knowledge base
  - Experiment history (Phase 2a/2b/2c)
  - What works, what doesn't
  - Performance metrics
  - Next steps

  - Next steps (Phase 2d)
  - Success criteria

## Why Archived

These documents were useful during development but became redundant after consolidation. They're kept here for historical reference in case we need to review specific decisions or details from each phase.
