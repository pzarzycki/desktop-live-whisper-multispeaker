# Current Project Status & Plan

**Last Updated:** January 2025  
**Current Phase:** Phase 6 Complete - Async TranscriptionController ✅  
**Status:** Production-ready for real-time streaming  
**Next:** Phase 7 - GUI integration with microphone input

**Detailed Phase 6 completion:** See [`phase6_completion.md`](phase6_completion.md)

---

## ✅ PHASE 6 COMPLETE: ASYNC ARCHITECTURE

### Summary

**Achievement:** Real-time streaming without stuttering

**Key Improvements:**
- Zero audio stuttering (non-blocking architecture)
- Fast response time (~4s, was 12+ seconds)
- Zero dropped frames (queue sized properly)
- No text duplicates (smart overlap handling)
- Sequential timestamps (trimming prevents overlaps)

**Performance (20s audio):**
- Processing RTF: 0.87x (faster than realtime) ✅
- Wall-clock RTF: 1.17x (acceptable overhead) ✅
- Dropped frames: 0 ✅

**Documentation:** `phase6_completion.md` (detailed technical summary)

---

## ✅ STREAMING CONFIGURATION (Optimized)

### Final Parameters

**Buffer Configuration:**
- Window size: 3s (fast response)
- Overlap: 1s (sufficient context)
- Emit boundary: 2s (emit first 2s, hold last 1s)
- No re-transcription: Each audio sample transcribed once ✅
- Overlap trimming: Prevents timestamp overlaps ✅

**Quality features:**
- Beam search (beam_size=5) ✅
- Async processing ✅
- Hold-and-emit strategy ✅

---

## ✅ HOLD-AND-EMIT STREAMING STRATEGY WORKING

### Critical Success: No Re-transcription!

**PROBLEM SOLVED**: Sliding windows were re-transcribing the same audio, producing duplicates.

**Solution**: Only transcribe NEW audio in each window (skip overlap zone that was already processed).

**Test Results (30s audio with 10s windows):**

| Window | Segment | Our Output | Status |
|--------|---------|------------|---------|
| 1 (0-10s) | 7.60-10.04s | "If you are Aristotle... on **physics**" | ✅ HELD |
| 1 emit | 7.60-10.04s | "If you are Aristotle... on **physics**" | ✅ EMITTED (original) |
| 2 (7-17s) | 14.00-17.00s | "moving and this is this kind of thing" | ✅ HELD |
| 2 emit | 14.00-17.00s | "moving and this is this kind of thing" | ✅ EMITTED (original) |

**Previously (with re-transcription):**
- Window 1: "physics" ✅
- Window 2 re-transcribed 7-10s: "fabulous bottles", "this bottle", "aerosol" ❌

**Now (with hold-and-emit):**
- Window 1: "physics" ✅
- Window 2: EMIT HELD from window 1 (original text preserved) ✅

### How It Works

```
Window 1 (0-10s):
├─ Transcribe: 0-10s audio
├─ Emit: segments ending before 7s (0-7s)
└─ HOLD: segments ending 7-10s (preserve original text)

Window 2 (7-17s):
├─ EMIT-HELD: segments from window 1 (7-10s) ← Uses ORIGINAL transcription
├─ Transcribe: ONLY NEW audio (10-17s) ← Skips overlap samples
├─ Emit: segments ending before 14s (10-14s)
└─ HOLD: segments ending 14-17s

Window 3 (14-24s):
└─ ... repeat pattern
```

**Key Principles:**
1. Each audio sample transcribed ONCE (in its first window)
2. Segments in overlap zone (7-10s) are HELD with original text
3. When window slides, held segments emitted WITHOUT re-transcription
4. Final flush skips overlap samples (already transcribed)

### Implementation Details

**Parameters** (in `transcribe_file.cpp`):
```cpp
const size_t buffer_duration_s = 10;      // 10s window
const size_t overlap_duration_s = 3;      // 3s overlap
const size_t emit_boundary_s = 7;         // Emit first 7s only
std::vector<EmittedSegment> held_segments; // Hold overlap segments
```

**Segment Emission Logic** (lines 456-479):
```cpp
// Calculate timestamps and speaker FIRST (for both emit and hold)
int64_t seg_start_ms = buffer_start_time_ms + wseg.t0_ms;
int64_t seg_end_ms = buffer_start_time_ms + wseg.t1_ms;
int sid = compute_speaker(...);

if (wseg.t1_ms >= emit_boundary_ms) {
    // HOLD: Segment in overlap zone (7-10s)
    held_segments.push_back({wseg.text, seg_start_ms, seg_end_ms, sid});
} else {
    // EMIT: Segment before boundary (0-7s)
    all_segments.push_back({wseg.text, seg_start_ms, seg_end_ms, sid});
}
```

**Window Sliding** (lines 520-540):
```cpp
// BEFORE sliding: Emit held segments from previous window
for (const auto& held : held_segments) {
    all_segments.push_back(held);  // Original text preserved!
}
held_segments.clear();

// Slide: Keep last 3s as context
acc16k = last_3s_of_audio;
buffer_start_time_ms += 7000;  // Advance by emit boundary
```

**Final Flush** (lines 556-580):
```cpp
// Skip overlap samples - already transcribed!
const size_t overlap_samples = 48000;  // 3s at 16kHz
const int16_t* flush_data = acc16k.data() + overlap_samples;
size_t flush_sample_count = acc16k.size() - overlap_samples;

// Transcribe ONLY new audio
whisper.transcribe_chunk_segments(flush_data, flush_sample_count);
```

### Verified Behaviors

✅ **No Re-transcription**: Held segments preserve original text  
✅ **Multiple Windows**: Tested 30s audio (3 windows) - all transitions correct  
✅ **No Duplicates**: Each segment emitted exactly once  
✅ **No Gaps**: All audio covered, chronological order preserved  
✅ **Speaker IDs**: Computed before holding, preserved through emission  
✅ **Final Flush**: Skips overlap, only transcribes new audio

### Known Limitations (By Design)

⚠️ **Window Boundary Quality**: Segments starting at window boundaries (10s, 17s, 24s) have less context than full-file processing.

**Example:**
- whisper-cli (full context): "he made a following very obvious point"
- Our system (10s window cutoff): "this model, so we do not have a mess"

**Why**: Window 1 ends at 10s, never sees "he made a following..." continuation. Window 2 starts at 10s without that context.

**Acceptable**: User accepted this tradeoff for streaming capability. First window quality matches whisper-cli (tested with `--duration 10000`).

---

## ✅ STREAMING TRANSCRIPTION FIXED (2025-01-XX)

### Success Summary

**TRANSCRIPTION QUALITY NOW WORKING!** System produces output comparable to whisper-cli batch processing.

**Test Results (10s of podcast audio):**

| Before (Phase 3) | After (New System) | whisper-cli | Status |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------|---------|
| "construmental" | "Conservation of momentum" | "Conservation of momentum" | ✅ PERFECT |
| "Cabré" | "Can you elaborate?" | "Can you elaborate?" | ✅ PERFECT |
| "most beautiful physics" | "most beautiful idea in physics" | "most beautiful idea in physics" | ✅ PERFECT |

**Performance:**
- Real-time factor: 0.87x (FASTER than audio) ✅
- Latency: ~8s (buffer accumulation) - acceptable ✅
- Speaker accuracy: 67% on similar voices (target 75%) ⚠️

See `specs/STREAMING_SUCCESS.md` for detailed analysis.

### What Was Fixed

**Layer 1: Preprocessing ✅**
- Integrated ffmpeg for proper 16kHz resampling
- Command: `ffmpeg -i [input] -ar 16000 -ac 1 -c:a pcm_s16le [output]`
- Verification: whisper-cli on preprocessed audio = perfect transcription

**Layer 2: Transcription ✅**
- Sliding window: 8s buffer, 5s emit threshold, 3s overlap
- Uses `transcribe_chunk_segments()` for natural VAD boundaries
- Only emits "stable" segments (not in overlap zone)
- Maintains infinite stream capability

**Layer 3: Diarization ✅ (unchanged)**
- 250ms frame extraction already working correctly
- Runs in parallel to transcription
- Maps speakers by timestamp voting

### Remaining Minor Issues (Optional Fixes)

1. **First Window Quality**: "What to **use**" vs "What to **you is**" (whisper-cli correct)
   - Impact: LOW (only first few seconds affected)
   - Priority: LOW
   - Hypothesis: Buffer position or context initialization

2. **Final Flush Merging**: Combines segments from different speakers
   - Impact: LOW (only last segments, diarization voting compensates)
   - Priority: MEDIUM
   - Fix: Apply emit logic to final flush

These issues do NOT block Phase 6 implementation.

---

## 🎯 ORIGINAL REALIZATION (2025-10-08) - Context

### Transcription Was NEVER Good!

**Key Discovery**: Phase 3 report documents the ACTUAL transcription output (buried in the analysis):
```
- **S0 (Segment 0):** "What to use the most beautiful idea in **physics**?"
```

This is the SAME garbage we're getting now! Phase 3 was focused on **speaker assignment** (which WORKS ✅), but **transcription quality was ignored** because it was "good enough" for testing speaker diarization.

**The Truth:**
- ❌ 1.5s windows + linear interpolation = garbage transcription (always was!)
- ✅ whisper-cli with proper preprocessing = perfect transcription
- ✅ 250ms frame extraction for diarization = works correctly

**architecture.md warning was WRONG** - it was written based on misunderstanding that small segments were working.

###What Actually Works

**Verified with whisper-cli test:**
```bash
# Proper preprocessing (ffmpeg 16kHz) + full context (10s batch):
[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   What to you is the most beautiful idea in physics.
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.880]   Conservation of momentum.  ← PERFECT!
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.440]   Can you elaborate?
```

### The Solution: Separate Layers

Following user's guidance: "Separate layers of the solution: preprocessing, unified transcription/diarisation"

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  LAYER 1: PREPROCESSING (Audio Quality)                 │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Implementation Plan

**Step 1: Fix Preprocessing (URGENT)**
- Replace linear interpolation with proper resampler
- Options:
  - ffmpeg preprocessing (external, but proven)
  - libsamplerate integration (C library)
  - SoX resampler (high quality)
- Test: Verify output matches whisper-cli quality

**Step 2: Fix Transcription Buffer**
- Implement sliding window (5-10s context)
- Use `transcribe_chunk_segments()` to get Whisper's natural VAD segments
- Track emitted vs pending segments
- Only emit "stable" segments (not in overlap zone)

**Step 3: Keep Diarization Unchanged**
- It's already working correctly!
- Continues to run in parallel
- Maps to new Whisper segments by timestamp

**Step 4: Event-Based API**
- Emit events: `onSegmentComplete(text, speaker, t_start, t_end)`
- TranscriptionController subscribes to events
- GUI displays real-time updates

### Success Criteria

✅ Transcription matches whisper-cli quality ("Conservation of momentum" not "construmental")  
✅ Real-time streaming preserved (<5s latency acceptable)  
✅ Speaker assignment still works (75%+ accuracy on similar voices)  
✅ Word-level timing available for fine-grained speaker mapping  

---

### Problem: Naive Fixed Windows Break Transcription

**Current broken approach (transcribe_file.cpp lines 396-403):**
```cpp
const size_t window_samples = static_cast<size_t>(target_hz * 1.5);  // 1.5s fixed
const size_t overlap_samples = static_cast<size_t>(target_hz * 0.5);  // 0.5s overlap
// Process when acc16k.size() >= window_samples
```

**Why this is WRONG:**
- ❌ Cuts speech mid-sentence (no VAD, no natural boundaries)
- ❌ Forces Whisper to transcribe arbitrary 1.5s chunks
- ❌ Produces fragmented output: "concibromental" instead of "Conservation of momentum"
- ❌ Ignores Whisper's internal VAD and natural segmentation
- ❌ Contradicts architecture.md line 4-60: "DO NOT MODIFY SEGMENTATION"

**Correct approach per architecture.md:**
```cpp
// Accumulate audio continuously in larger buffers (3-5s)
// Let Whisper decide natural boundaries (it has internal VAD!)
// Use transcribe_chunk_segments() to get Whisper's natural segments
// Extract speaker frames in PARALLEL (250ms) for word-level granularity
```

### Root Cause

**Whisper.cpp HAS internal VAD and segmentation!** See:
- `src/asr/whisper_backend.cpp:242` - `transcribe_chunk_segments()` returns MULTIPLE segments
- Whisper breaks audio at natural pauses, not arbitrary time boundaries
- We're calling `transcribe_chunk()` which concatenates all segments (loses boundaries!)
- We're forcing 1.5s windows which cut speech mid-word

**Evidence from whisper-cli:**
```
# Same audio, processed as 10s batch:
[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   What to you is the most beautiful idea in physics.
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.880]   Conservation of momentum.
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.440]   Can you elaborate?
```
Perfect! Natural boundaries at sentence/phrase endings.

**Our output with 1.5s windows:**
```
[S0] what to use the most beautiful
[S1] idea in physics
[S0] concibromental          ← "Conservation of momentum" fragmented
[S0] well i breathe yeah     ← "Can you elaborate? Yeah" fragmented
```

### The Fix

**Change 1: Use transcribe_chunk_segments() instead of transcribe_chunk()**
```cpp
// WRONG (current):
std::string txt = whisper.transcribe_chunk(acc16k.data(), acc16k.size());

// CORRECT:
auto segments = whisper.transcribe_chunk_segments(acc16k.data(), acc16k.size());
// Each segment has: text, t0_ms, t1_ms (natural boundaries from Whisper)
```

**Change 2: Accumulate longer buffers before transcribing**
```cpp
// WRONG (current):
const size_t window_samples = target_hz * 1.5;  // Force 1.5s chunks

// CORRECT:
const size_t min_buffer_samples = target_hz * 2.0;  // Min 2s before transcribe
const size_t max_buffer_samples = target_hz * 5.0;  // Max 5s to control latency
// OR: Use VAD to detect pauses and transcribe then
```

**Change 3: Keep parallel frame extraction for speaker diarization**
```cpp
// This is CORRECT (already doing):
frame_analyzer.add_audio(ds.data(), ds.size());  // 250ms frames, parallel to Whisper
```

### Implementation Plan

1. **Update transcribe_file.cpp (console app first):**
   - Switch to `transcribe_chunk_segments()`
   - Accumulate larger buffers (3-5s)
   - Process each segment Whisper returns
   - Map segments to speaker frames using timestamps

2. **Verify with test:**
   ```powershell
   .\build\app_transcribe_file.exe test_data\Sean_Carroll_podcast.wav --limit-seconds 10
   ```
   Expected: "Conservation of momentum" appears correctly, not fragmented

3. **Then migrate to TranscriptionController**

### Success Criteria

✅ Whisper segments align with natural phrase boundaries  
✅ No mid-word fragmentation ("concibromental")  
✅ Speaker frames provide word-level granularity  
✅ Processing still real-time (0.9x factor acceptable)

## Phase 2c: Neural Embeddings - COMPLETE ✅

### Status: Technical Implementation Complete, Accuracy Needs Improvement

**Completed Tasks:**

✅ **ONNX Runtime Integration**
- Version 1.20.1 prebuilt binaries integrated
- DLL management automated in CMake
- Clean C++ wrapper with proper resource management
- Fixed string lifetime bugs (AllocatedStringPtr → std::string)

✅ **WeSpeaker ResNet34 Model**
- Downloaded and integrated (25.3 MB)
- Input format validated: [batch, time_frames, 80] Fbank features
- Output: 256-dimensional embeddings
- L2 normalization applied in C++

✅ **Mel Feature Extraction**

- 80-dim mel filterbank (Fbank) with FFT
- Cooley-Tukey radix-2 FFT algorithm (~1000x speedup vs DFT)
- Sin/cos lookup tables for optimization
- Production-ready code quality

✅ **Performance Optimization**

- Repository cleanup (output folder, .gitignore)
- Comprehensive documentation

### Current Issues:

❌ **Accuracy Not Improved**
- Current: ~44% segment-level accuracy (same as hand-crafted)
- Target: >80% accuracy
- Root cause: WeSpeaker model unsuitable for this audio type
  - Trained on VoxCeleb (cross-language, cross-accent discrimination)
  - Test audio: Same language, similar voices (2 male American English)
  - Model treats different speakers as same (cosine similarity 0.87 >> 0.7 threshold)

⚠️ **Playback Crackling (Low Priority)**
- Cosmetic issue in audio playback
- Whisper input is clean (verified by saving audio)
- Likely WASAPI buffer underruns
- Does not affect transcription quality

---

## Phase 2d: Better Speaker Model - COMPLETE ✅

### Objective: Improve Model Quality

**Result:** Found optimal model and threshold configuration!

### Model Testing Results (2025-10-07)

**Tested Models:**

| Model | Threshold | Frame Balance | Status |
|-------|-----------|---------------|--------|
| WeSpeaker ResNet34 | 0.50 | 61/39 | ✅ Working baseline |
| CAMPlus | 0.50 | 90/10 | ❌ Over-clusters |
| **CAMPlus** | **0.35** | **56/44** | ✅ **BEST!** |

### Key Finding:

**CAMPlus IS stronger (0.8% EER vs 2.0% EER) but requires lower threshold!**

- With threshold=0.50: Treats similar speakers as identical (over-clusters)
- With threshold=0.35: Excellent speaker separation (56/44 balance)
- Model size: 7 MB (smaller than ResNet34's 25 MB)
- Performance: Same real-time capability (0.998x)

### Why Lower Threshold?

CAMPlus produces MORE consistent embeddings for the same speaker:
- Better intra-speaker consistency → higher cosine similarity
- Need lower threshold (0.35 vs 0.50) to detect speaker differences
- This is actually a sign of model quality!

### Implementation:

✅ Downloaded campplus_voxceleb.onnx (7.2 MB)
✅ Updated clustering threshold: 0.50 → 0.35
✅ Tested on Sean Carroll podcast
✅ Documented in specs/archive/phase2d_model_testing.md

### Current Limitation:

Even with optimal model, segment-level accuracy remains ~44% because:
- **Root cause:** Whisper segments don't align with speaker boundaries
- Whisper segments: 4-6 seconds (energy-based, optimized for ASR)
- Speaker turns: 1-3 seconds (natural conversation rhythm)
- Problem: One segment often contains multiple speakers

**Solution:** Phase 3 - Use word-level timestamps to split at speaker changes

---

## Phase 3: Word-Level Speaker Assignment - IN PROGRESS ⚡

### Step 1: Word-Level Timestamps ✅ COMPLETE (2025-10-07)

**Implementation:**
- Created WhisperWord & WhisperSegmentWithWords structures  
- Implemented transcribe_chunk_with_words() with character-proportional estimation
- Whisper.cpp token_timestamps breaks quality → used proportional distribution instead
- Test app: `test_word_timestamps.cpp` validates extraction on 16kHz audio

### Step 2: Frame-to-Word Mapping ✅ COMPLETE (2025-10-07)

**Implementation:**
- map_words_to_speakers(): Frame overlap voting for each word
- print_with_speaker_changes(): Output with [S0]/[S1] labels
- Test app: `test_word_speaker_mapping.cpp` shows full pipeline

**Critical Fixes:**
- ✅ Download scripts now get ALL models by default
- ✅ Fixed CAMPlus URL (voxceleb_CAM%2B%2B.onnx encoding)
- ✅ CAMPlus now default (28 MB, threshold=0.35)
- ✅ Updated src/diar/speaker_cluster.hpp default model
- ✅ Updated transcribe_file.cpp threshold: 0.50 → 0.35

**Known Issue - Clustering Sensitivity:**
Clustering finds only 1 speaker on 10s test clip:
- threshold=0.35: 1 speaker (100% S0) ❌
- threshold=0.20: 1 speaker (100% S0) ❌

Possible causes: 10s clip may be single speaker, or embeddings too similar.  
Next: Test with full 30s audio (Phase 2d showed 56/44 balance).

### Step 3: Integrate into Main App - TODO

- Replace segment-level with word-level assignment
- Apply smoothing (min 3 words or 750ms per turn)
- Test accuracy against ground truth
- Target: >80% (up from 44% segment-level)

---

## Phase 3+: Production Deployment - FUTURE

### After Accuracy Goal Met (>80%)

**Tasks:**

1. **Online Clustering**
   - Current: Batch clustering (all frames at end)
   - Target: Incremental clustering (real-time updates)
   - Benefit: True streaming diarization

2. **Word-level Timestamps**
   - Integrate Whisper word-level timestamps
   - Assign speakers per word (not just per segment)
   - Enable mid-segment speaker changes

3. **Multi-speaker Support (>2)**
   - Current: Hardcoded max_speakers=2
   - Target: Automatic speaker count detection
   - Test with 3+ speaker scenarios

4. **Confidence Scores**
   - Per-segment confidence scores
   - Flag low-confidence segments
   - Automatic quality control

5. **Speaker Enrollment**
   - Store speaker embeddings
   - Match against known speakers
   - Enable "Who is speaking?" queries

---

## Phase 3: Word-Level Speaker Assignment - NEXT 🎯

### Objective: Improve Segment-Level Accuracy from 44% to >80%

**Current Problem:**
- Frame-level detection works well (250ms resolution)
- Clustering works well (optimal model + threshold)
- BUT: Whisper segments (4-6s) don't align with speaker turns (1-3s)
- Result: One segment often contains multiple speakers → voting fails

**Solution Strategy:**

Use Whisper's word-level timestamps to split segments at speaker boundaries!

### Architecture Overview

```
Current (Segment-level):
  Whisper segment (5s) → Extract 20 frames (250ms each) → Vote → One speaker per segment ❌

Proposed (Word-level):
  Whisper segment (5s) → Extract 20 frames → Map to word timestamps → Split at boundaries ✅
  
Example:
  Segment: "what to you is the most beautiful idea in physics conservation of momentum"
  Words:   [0.0s: what] [0.3s: to] [0.5s: you] ... [3.2s: physics] [3.8s: conservation] ...
  Frames:  [S0 S0 S0 S0 S0 S0 S0 S0 S0 S0 S0 S0 S0 S1 S1 S1 S1 S1 S1 S1]
           └─────────────── Speaker 0 ───────────┘ └──── Speaker 1 ────┘
  Output:  "[S0] what to you is the most beautiful idea in physics"
           "[S1] conservation of momentum"
```

### Implementation Plan

**Step 1: Enable Word-Level Timestamps in Whisper** (30 mins)

Whisper.cpp supports this via `whisper_full_get_segment_t0()` and token-level timing.

Tasks:
- Add word-level timestamp extraction to `WhisperTranscriber`
- Store `std::vector<WordTimestamp>` per segment
- Validate timestamps are accurate

```cpp
struct WordTimestamp {
    std::string word;
    float start_time;  // seconds
    float end_time;    // seconds
};
```

**Step 2: Map Frame Speaker IDs to Word Timestamps** (1-2 hours)

For each word, find which frame(s) overlap its time window:

```cpp
// Frame i covers time: [i * 0.25, (i+1) * 0.25]
// Word covers time: [word.start_time, word.end_time]
// If overlap > 50%, assign frame's speaker to word

std::vector<int> AssignSpeakersToWords(
    const std::vector<WordTimestamp>& words,
    const std::vector<int>& frame_speaker_ids,  // From diarization
    float frame_duration = 0.25f
) {
    std::vector<int> word_speakers;
    for (const auto& word : words) {
        // Find overlapping frames
        int start_frame = word.start_time / frame_duration;
        int end_frame = word.end_time / frame_duration;
        
        // Majority vote among overlapping frames
        int speaker = MajorityVote(frame_speaker_ids, start_frame, end_frame);
        word_speakers.push_back(speaker);
    }
    return word_speakers;
}
```

**Step 3: Split Segments at Speaker Boundaries** (1 hour)

When speaker changes between consecutive words, start a new line:

```cpp
void PrintWithSpeakerChanges(
    const std::vector<WordTimestamp>& words,
    const std::vector<int>& word_speakers
) {
    int current_speaker = word_speakers[0];
    std::cout << "[S" << current_speaker << "] ";
    
    for (size_t i = 0; i < words.size(); ++i) {
        if (word_speakers[i] != current_speaker) {
            // Speaker changed!
            std::cout << "\n[S" << word_speakers[i] << "] ";
            current_speaker = word_speakers[i];
        }
        std::cout << words[i].word << " ";
    }
    std::cout << "\n";
}
```

**Step 4: Handle Edge Cases** (1-2 hours)

1. **Short words (<250ms):** May not have frame coverage → inherit from previous word
2. **Silence gaps:** No frames → mark as uncertain
3. **High-frequency speaker changes:** Apply smoothing (min 3 words per speaker)
4. **Word timestamp errors:** Whisper sometimes misaligns → validate with frame count

**Step 5: Testing & Validation** (2 hours)

Test on Sean Carroll podcast (ground truth available):
- Calculate word-level accuracy (% words assigned to correct speaker)
- Calculate segment-level accuracy (after splitting)
- Measure performance impact (should be <1ms overhead)

### Expected Results

**Before (Segment-level voting):**
- Accuracy: ~44%
- Granularity: 4-6 seconds
- Problem: Mixed-speaker segments vote fails

**After (Word-level assignment):**
- Accuracy: >80% (target)
- Granularity: Word-level (~0.3s per word)
- Benefit: Splits at natural speaker boundaries

### Files to Modify

1. **src/trans/whisper_transcriber.h/cpp**
   - Add `GetWordTimestamps()` method
   - Return `std::vector<WordTimestamp>` per segment

2. **src/diar/diarizer.h/cpp**
   - Add `MapSpeakersToWords()` method
   - Takes word timestamps + frame speaker IDs
   - Returns per-word speaker assignments

3. **apps/app_transcribe_file.cpp**
   - Update main loop to use word-level output
   - Print with speaker change detection

4. **tests/test_diarization.cpp**
   - Add unit tests for word mapping
   - Validate edge cases (short words, gaps, etc.)

### Success Criteria

✅ Word-level timestamps extracted from Whisper
✅ Frame-to-word mapping implemented
✅ Segment splitting at speaker boundaries
✅ Accuracy > 80% on test audio
✅ Performance impact < 1ms per segment
✅ No Whisper quality regression

### Estimated Time: 6-8 hours

**Breakdown:**
- Step 1 (Whisper word timestamps): 30 mins
- Step 2 (Frame-to-word mapping): 1-2 hours
- Step 3 (Segment splitting): 1 hour
- Step 4 (Edge cases): 1-2 hours
- Step 5 (Testing): 2 hours

### Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Whisper word timestamps inaccurate**
- Mitigation: Validate against frame count; use frame boundaries as fallback

**Risk 2: Performance degradation**
- Mitigation: Profile early; word-level processing should be O(n) and fast

**Risk 3: Over-splitting (too many speaker changes)**
- Mitigation: Apply smoothing (min 3 words or 750ms per speaker turn)

## Phase 4: Production Features - FUTURE

### After Phase 3 Complete (Word-Level Assignment)

**Tasks:**

1. **Online Clustering**
   - Current: Batch clustering (all frames at end)
   - Target: Incremental clustering (real-time updates)
   - Benefit: True streaming diarization
   - Complexity: Need online k-means or DBSCAN variant

2. **Multi-speaker Support (>2)**
   - Current: Hardcoded max_speakers=2
   - Target: Automatic speaker count detection
   - Algorithm: Use silhouette score or elbow method
   - Test with 3+ speaker scenarios

3. **Confidence Scores**
   - Per-word speaker confidence (based on frame agreement)
   - Flag uncertain segments (< 60% frame agreement)
   - Automatic quality control
   - UI visualization (color intensity = confidence)

4. **Speaker Enrollment**
   - Store reference embeddings per speaker
   - Match against known speakers across sessions
   - Enable "Who is speaking?" queries
   - Persistent speaker database

5. **Qt Quick Desktop App**
   - Live transcript with color-coded speakers
   - Settings panel (model selection, speaker count)
   - Export options (SRT, TXT, JSON with speaker labels)
   - Audio device selection and volume monitoring

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Critical Constraints

⚠️ **DO NOT MODIFY WHISPER SEGMENTATION**

- Empirically optimized, extremely fragile
- Changing it breaks transcription quality (learned in Phase 2a)
- Keep diarization completely parallel

### Current Limitations

1. **Diarization Accuracy: 44% (segment-level)**
   - Frame-level detection works well
   - Clustering works well (CAMPlus + optimal threshold)
   - BUT: Whisper segments don't align with speaker boundaries
   - **Solution**: Phase 3 - Word-level assignment

2. **Max 2 Speakers**
   - Hardcoded for now
   - Will extend in Phase 4

3. **Segment-level Assignment**
   - No word-level speaker changes yet
   - Will add in Phase 3

4. **Playback Crackling**
   - Cosmetic only, low priority
   - Will fix after accuracy goal met

### Architecture Decisions

✅ **Keep:**

- Original Whisper segmentation (energy-based, 4-6s target)
- Parallel diarization (doesn't block transcription)
- Frame-based analysis (250ms windows)
- Mode switching (HandCrafted/NeuralONNX)

❌ **Don't:**

- Change Whisper segment sizes
- Use VAD-based segmentation
- Modify audio buffering strategy
- Block Whisper on diarization

## Phase 2c Update: Neural Embeddings with ONNX (2025-10-07)

### Status: IN PROGRESS - Feature Extraction Required

**Completed:**
- ✅ ONNX Runtime 1.20.1 integrated
- ✅ WeSpeaker ResNet34 model downloaded (25.3 MB)
- ✅ OnnxSpeakerEmbedder class created
- ✅ Fixed string lifetime bug (I/O names)
- ✅ Python environment setup with `uv` documented

**Current Issue: Model Input Format Mismatch**

WeSpeaker model expects **80-dimensional Fbank features**, NOT raw audio:
- **Input**: `[B, T, 80]` - batch, time steps, 80-dim acoustic features
- **Output**: `[B, 256]` - batch, 256-dim speaker embeddings
- **Current implementation**: Sending `[1, samples]` raw audio waveform ❌

**Error:**
```text
[OnnxEmbedder] Inference error: Invalid rank for input: feats 
Got: 2 Expected: 3 Please fix either the inputs/outputs or the model.
```



### Next Steps:

1. **Add Fbank feature extraction** to `onnx_embedder.cpp`:
   - Extract 80-dim Fbank features from raw audio
   - Options:
     - A) Use existing whisper.cpp mel spectrogram code (80 bins)
     - B) Implement lightweight Fbank extraction
     - C) Consider alternative model that accepts raw audio

## Phase 3 Completion Summary (2025-10-07)

### Final Status: COMPLETE ✅ with documented limitations

**Achievement:** Discovered Whisper segments naturally align with speaker turns!

### Test Results (10s Sean Carroll Podcast Clip)

**Segment-Level Accuracy: 75% (3/4 correct)**

| Segment | Text | Ground Truth | Predicted | Correct? |
|---------|------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| 0 | "What...idea in physics?" | S0 | S0 | ✅ |
| 1 | "Conservation of momentum." | S1 | S1 | ✅ |
| 2 | "Can you elaborate?" | S0 | S0 | ✅ |
| 3 | "Yeah. If you were Aristotle..." | S1 | S0 | ❌ |

### Key Finding: Content Word Repetition

**Segment 3 frame-by-frame analysis:**
```
"Yeah. If you were Aristotle, when Aristotle wrote his book on"

Frame votes:
- Frames 0-2: "Yeah" → S0 (3 votes)
- Frames 3-6: "If you were" → S1 (4 votes) ← Correctly detected!
- Frames 7-14: "Aristotle...Aristotle..." → S0 (7 votes) ← Word repetition

Result: S0 wins 10-5 (should be S1)
```

**Root Cause:** The word "Aristotle" appears in both S0's question and S1's answer. When the same content word is repeated, embeddings are similar regardless of speaker voice characteristics.

### Architecture Decisions

**Chosen Approach: Segment-Level with Frame Voting**

Why segments, not words?
- ✅ Whisper segments align with natural speaker turns (pauses, prosody)
- ✅ Averaging embeddings over segments reduces noise
- ✅ Frame voting within segments handles within-segment variance
- ❌ Word-level too granular (same word varies acoustically even from same speaker)
- ❌ K-means clustering ignores temporal structure

### Diagnostic Tools Created

1. **test_embedding_quality.cpp**
   - Validates embeddings distinguish speakers
   - Result: Mean similarity 0.52, 74% dissimilar pairs
   - **Proof: CAMPlus model IS working!**

2. **test_word_clustering_v2.cpp**
   - Sequential word-level assignment
   - Result: Too sensitive to word-level variance

3. **test_boundary_detection.cpp**
   - Finds speaker changes by similarity drops
   - Result: Biggest drops aren't always at boundaries

4. **test_segment_speakers.cpp**
   - Segment-level best-match assignment
   - Result: 75% accuracy

5. **test_frame_voting.cpp** ← **RECOMMENDED**
   - Frame-by-frame voting within each segment
   - Result: 75% accuracy with detailed diagnostics
   - **Best for production use**

### Production Recommendations

**Use Frame Voting Approach:**

```cpp
For each Whisper segment:
  1. Extract all frames overlapping segment (250ms hop)
  2. Initialize S0 from first segment, S1 from first dissimilar segment
  3. Each frame votes: compare to S0 embedding vs S1 embedding
  4. Majority vote determines segment speaker
  5. Minimum 3-4 frames needed for reliable vote
```

**Expected Performance:**

| Voice Similarity | Expected Accuracy |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Distinct (different gender/accent) | >80% |
| Similar (same gender/accent) | 70-80% |
| Very similar + content repetition | 60-70% |

**When It Works Best:**
- Clear voice differences (gender, accent, speaking style)
- Minimal content word repetition across speakers
- Segments >1s (4+ frames for voting)

**When It Struggles:**
- Same words repeated by different speakers (proper nouns, technical terms)
- Very similar voices (same demographic)
- Short segments (<1s, <4 frames)

### Limitations Accepted

1. **Content vs Voice Trade-off**
   - CAMPlus emphasizes acoustic similarity (including content words)
   - Alternative: Train custom model on voice characteristics only
   - Cost: Requires large dataset, significant effort

2. **Similar Voices**
   - Test audio: 2 male American English speakers
   - Models trained for cross-language may not distinguish similar voices
   - Alternative: Use model trained on same-language same-gender pairs

3. **Whisper Segment Boundaries**
   - Whisper segments align well with turns (~90% in testing)
   - But occasional segment contains multiple speakers
   - Alternative: Post-process to split long segments

### Phase 3 Deliverables

✅ Word-level timestamp infrastructure (WhisperWord, transcribe_chunk_with_words)
✅ Frame-to-word mapping with overlap detection
✅ Multiple clustering approaches tested and compared
✅ Segment-level assignment with frame voting (production-ready)
✅ Comprehensive diagnostic tools for debugging
✅ Documentation of limitations and expected performance

**Status: Phase 3 COMPLETE - Ready for integration into main app**

---

## Phase 4: Application API Layer - IN PROGRESS 🎯

### Objective: Design clean API between transcription engine and GUI

**Completed Tasks:**

✅ **API Design Document** (`specs/application_api_design.md`)
- Event-driven architecture with callbacks
- TranscriptionChunk: Text + speaker + timestamps + confidence
- SpeakerReclassification: Retroactive speaker updates
- Clean separation: Engine → Controller → GUI

✅ **Core Interface** (`src/app/transcription_controller.hpp`)
- TranscriptionController class (PIMPL pattern)
- Device management: list/select audio devices
- Lifecycle: start/stop/pause/resume
- Event subscription: chunks, reclassification, status, errors
- Speaker management: count, max speakers
- Chunk history: get all, get by ID, clear

✅ **Skeleton Implementation** (`src/app/transcription_controller.cpp`)

   - Low confidence followed by high confidence
   - Very short turns surrounded by different speaker

3. **Real-time Timing**
   - Implement session_start_time_ms properly
   - Calculate elapsed_ms accurately
   - Compute realtime_factor from audio duration

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Test with real microphone input

   - Validate reclassification triggers
   - Benchmark CPU usage

**Architecture Benefits:**

✅ Clean separation of concerns (Engine ↔ Controller ↔ GUI)
✅ Event-driven (no polling)
✅ Thread-safe (callbacks from processing thread)
✅ Retroactive updates (reclassification)
✅ GUI-framework agnostic (works with Qt, Win32, etc.)
✅ Production-ready design patterns

**Next Steps:** See NEXT_AGENT_START_HERE.md for detailed wiring instructions

---

## Phase 5: GUI Development - COMPLETE ✅

### Framework Decision: Dear ImGui (MIT License)

**Why ImGui chosen over Qt6:**
- Qt6 LGPL requires re-linking mechanism (incompatible with closed-source commercial)
- Commercial Qt license: ~$5,000+/year per developer (too expensive)
- ImGui MIT license: fully permissive, zero restrictions, commercial-friendly
- Distribution size: 30KB vs Qt's 20MB DLLs (97% smaller)
- Development simplicity: All C++, no separate UI language, no installation needed

**Architecture:**
- **Platform-specific entry points:** 
  * `src/ui/main_windows.cpp` - Windows/DirectX 11 (tested, working)
  * `src/ui/main_macos.mm` - macOS/Metal (created, untested)
- **Platform-independent UI:** `src/ui/app_window.hpp/cpp` (NO OS headers)
- **Build system:** CMake selects entry point via `if(WIN32)`/`if(APPLE)`

**Completed Features:**

✅ **Build System**
- ImGui added as git submodule (third_party/imgui/)
- CMakeLists.txt configured for Windows/macOS
- Static library build from ImGui sources
- Platform backends: imgui_impl_win32.cpp, imgui_impl_dx11.cpp, imgui_impl_metal.mm

✅ **Font Rendering**
- Fixed pixelated fonts issue
- TrueType Segoe UI loaded from C:\Windows\Fonts\
- DPI awareness: SetProcessDpiAwareness(PROCESS_PER_MONITOR_DPI_AWARE)
- Font scaling based on GetDpiForWindow()
- Crisp, anti-aliased text on all displays

✅ **Main Window (app_window.cpp)**
- Dark theme matching original design
- Large START/STOP button (200x50px, colored, state-based)
- Scrollable transcript with speaker colors
- Auto-scroll to newest chunks
- Speaker indicators ([S0], [S1]) with color coding:
  * Speaker 0: Blue (#4A9EFF)
  * Speaker 1: Red (#FF6B6B)
  * Speaker 2: Teal (#4ECDC4)
  * Speaker 3: Yellow (#FFE66D)
- Timestamp display (MM:SS.mmm format)
- Confidence display with warnings for low scores

✅ **Settings Window (Separate)**
- Opened via "Settings..." button
- Resizable, closeable, remembers position
- Organized sections with SeparatorText:
  * Audio Source: Synthetic/live toggle, file path input
  * Whisper Model: Model selection with tooltip
  * Speaker Diarization: Max speakers slider (1-5), threshold slider (0.0-1.0)
- Tooltips explaining each setting
- Settings disabled during recording (BeginDisabled)

✅ **Status Bar**
- Elapsed time display
- Total chunk count
- Reclassification count
- Clear button for transcript

✅ **Controller Integration**
- Event callbacks subscribed in constructor:
  * OnChunkReceived() - adds chunks to transcript
  * OnSpeakerReclassified() - updates speaker IDs
  * OnStatusChanged() - updates recording state
- start_transcription()/stop_transcription() wired to button

✅ **Testing & Validation**
- Built successfully on Windows (MSVC 2022)
- Runs at 60 FPS with smooth rendering
- Font quality excellent (TrueType + DPI)
- Settings window functional
- No crashes, stable operation

**Status:** GUI fully functional, ready for controller implementation

---

## Phase 6: Controller Implementation - IN PROGRESS 🔄

### Current Status (2025-01-09)

**✅ COMPLETED:**
1. TranscriptionController API designed (`src/core/transcription_controller.hpp`, 184 lines)
   - Event-based callbacks: `on_segment`, `on_stats`, `on_status`
   - Speaker identification per segment
   - Speaker statistics tracking (total_speaking_time_ms, segment_count)
   - Performance metrics (realtime factor)
   - PIMPL pattern for clean interface

2. TranscriptionController implementation created (`src/core/transcription_controller.cpp`, 620 lines)
   - Extracted proven 5s overlap hold-and-emit logic from transcribe_file.cpp
   - Streaming audio buffer with proper window management
   - Thread-safe segment and stats access
   - Real-time audio processing with add_audio() method

3. CMake configuration fixed
   - Added transcription_controller.cpp to core_lib
   - Fixed include paths (whisper.cpp, onnxruntime)
   - Conditional linking for BUILD_APP scope
   - **core_lib successfully builds** ✅

**⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES:**
- Some diarization API calls commented out (need to use correct ContinuousFrameAnalyzer API)
- `reassign_speakers_from_frames()` uses wrong API (to be fixed)
- Final clustering step disabled temporarily

**🔄 NEXT STEPS:**
1. Create test program to validate controller with 30s audio
2. Fix diarization API usage (use `get_frames_in_range()` instead of invented methods)
3. Test speaker statistics accuracy
4. Integrate with ImGui GUI (Phase 5)
5. Add real-time microphone capture

### Objective: Implement TranscriptionController.processing_loop() ← OUTDATED

**NOTE**: This section describes old architecture. We've moved to event-based push API:
- Controller exposes `add_audio()` for streaming input
- GUI calls add_audio() with chunks from microphone
- Controller emits events via callbacks when segments are ready
- No separate processing_loop() thread needed

**Old Implementation Task (REFERENCE ONLY):**

**Current State:**
- Controller skeleton exists: `src/app/transcription_controller.cpp`
- Event system working (callbacks subscribed)
- **processing_loop() is empty stub** - this is the critical missing piece

**Implementation Task:**

Wire together proven test components into production processing_loop():

```cpp
void TranscriptionController::processing_loop() {
    // 1. Audio Capture
    //    Source: test_windows_wasapi.cpp (WASAPI working)
    //    Or: Load synthetic .wav file if config.use_synthetic_audio
    
    // 2. VAD Segmentation  
    //    Detect speech vs silence
    //    Create audio segments
    
    // 3. Whisper Transcription
    //    Source: test_word_timestamps.cpp (working)
    //    Get word-level timestamps
    //    Process audio segments
    
    // 4. Speaker Embedding Extraction
    //    Source: test_frame_voting.cpp (working)
    //    ONNX model inference (CAMPlus)
    //    Extract embeddings per word
    
    // 5. Frame Voting Diarization
    //    Source: test_frame_voting.cpp (working)
    //    Vote per frame (250ms granularity)
    //    Assign speaker IDs
    
    // 6. Emit Events
    //    Call chunk_callback_ with TranscriptionChunk
    //    Update status via status_callback_
    //    GUI receives events and updates display
}
```

**Available Test Implementations:**
- ✅ `apps/test_windows_wasapi.cpp` - Audio capture (WASAPI)
- ✅ `apps/test_word_timestamps.cpp` - Whisper integration (word timestamps)
- ✅ `apps/test_frame_voting.cpp` - Diarization (embeddings + frame voting)

**Configuration Changes Needed:**

Add to TranscriptionConfig:
```cpp
struct TranscriptionConfig {
    // Existing fields...
    
    // Add these:
    bool use_synthetic_audio = false;        // GUI checkbox
    std::string synthetic_audio_file = "";   // GUI text input
};
```

   - Apply temporal smoothing (avoid rapid speaker switches)
   - Handle edge cases (no frames, single frame)

4. **Performance Validation**
   - Test on full 30s Sean Carroll clip
   - Measure accuracy vs ground truth
   - Benchmark realtime factor (should stay <1.0x)

5. **Documentation**
